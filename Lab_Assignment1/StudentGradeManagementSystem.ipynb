does not appear to be a clear or strong linear relationship between English and Math grades. The points are scattered across the plot without forming any discernible pattern or trend, such as an upward or downward slope. This suggests that a student's performance in English does not necessarily predict their performance in Math based on the data in this scatter plot."],"metadata":{"id":"OVoAuCILeVbP"},"id":"OVoAuCILeVbP"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.9"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
